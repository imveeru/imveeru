Hello!
Here's a formula: **(β ∧ Φ) + γ = Ω** , tried decoding it?

It’s just **"(Busy and Productive) + Curiosity = Peace"** — that’s how I work.

Here’s what has kept me productively busy over time:
 - Building AI/ML products that turn data into gold 💰. [1yr of exp.]
 - Cracking and analyzing customer journeys to level up experiences. (🕵️ Sherlock Mode: ON)
 - Developed high-performing scalable web apps, recommendation systems, and AR Games (30k users loved it!) [2yrs of exp.]
 - Managed a 40+ member team for one of India’s largest tech fests. (Thanks to :coffee: & 🥤)
 - Created 👀-catching designs for 25+ international clients—posters, UIs, logos.
 - Researching what fuels my curiosity (5 publications so far...)

and here's what I'm curious about:
 - Exploring if Gen AI will channel Van Gogh’s creativity or Terminator’s efficiency
 - Seeing if Generative 3D modeling can solve big problems 
 - Testing whether LLMs can tackle complex optimization challenges
… and a whole lot more.
